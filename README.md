# BLADE

**The AI that watches, learns, and works — while others just talk.**

Not a chat window. An operating intelligence wired into your screen, files, apps, and memory. Runs 5 agents in parallel. Remembers everything you've looked at. Sees your screen. Controls your desktop. Fully local.

## Why BLADE exists

Every AI tool on the market runs one agent at a time, forgets everything between sessions, and has no idea what's on your screen. BLADE is what happens when you refuse to accept that.

- **Hermes Agent** — lives in your Telegram DMs. No screen awareness, no native desktop, no computer use.
- **OpenClaw** — a WhatsApp chatbot with 355K stars and 9 CVEs. No screen control, flat Markdown memory.
- **Screenpipe** — great screen recorder, that's it. No agents, no chat, no tools.
- **Jan / LM Studio** — polished model launchers. No agents, no memory, no automation.
- **Open Interpreter** — runs code in a terminal. Blind to your screen, no parallelism.

**BLADE does all of it. Natively. In one app.**

## Core Features

### BLADE Swarm — Parallel Multi-Agent Orchestration
Give BLADE a complex goal. It decomposes it into a DAG of sub-tasks and runs up to 5 specialized agents simultaneously. Agents share a scratchpad — findings from one feed directly into the next. When all tasks complete, BLADE synthesizes a final result.

No other desktop AI runs more than one agent at a time. BLADE runs a fleet.

### Total Recall — Screen Timeline with Semantic Search
BLADE captures a screenshot every 30 seconds, fingerprints it (identical frames are skipped), runs a vision model description on it, and embeds everything for semantic search.

*"What error was I debugging Tuesday?"* — finds the exact screenshot in seconds.

This is Rewind.ai, open-source, built into BLADE. Rewind charges $30/month. BLADE is free.

### God Mode — Live Screen Context
Runs in the background, capturing your active window title, clipboard contents, and running apps every N minutes. Every AI call gets this context injected automatically. The model knows what you're working on without being told.

### Computer Use — Desktop Agent
BLADE can see your screen and control it. Click buttons, fill forms, read UI elements with OCR, navigate apps, take screenshots and reason about them. 40+ desktop action types.

### Persistent Memory — Compounds Over Time
Every conversation, command, and tool result is embedded locally and indexed with hybrid BM25 + vector search (Reciprocal Rank Fusion). The second week is smarter than the first.

### Background Agents
Spawn Claude Code, Aider, or Goose as background workers with one command. BLADE stays the orchestrator — one surface, multiple specialists.

### Auto-Evolving MCP Catalog
BLADE ships with 20+ MCP servers pre-catalogued and auto-installs them as you use new apps — Git, Chrome, Linear, Figma, Slack, databases, terminals. The toolkit grows without you touching a config file.

### Global Voice Input
`Ctrl+Shift+V` from anywhere — record, transcribe via Whisper, auto-fill QuickAsk. No window switching.

### BLADE Cron
Schedule recurring autonomous tasks: *"every Monday at 9am, summarize my GitHub notifications and brief me on what matters."* Runs while you sleep.

### Evolution Engine
Background research loop that monitors AI news, suggests new MCP tools to install, and runs a morning briefing pulse. BLADE is always improving itself.

### Pentest Mode
Security testing with mandatory ownership verification. Uses Groq or Ollama — never your Anthropic key. Kali tools, nmap, sqlmap, metasploit — all gated behind an explicit authorization record.

All data is local: `~/.blade/blade.db` (SQLite), `~/.blade/screenshots/` (Total Recall). No cloud sync, no telemetry. API calls go directly to your configured provider using your own key.

## Privacy

| Data | Where it goes |
|------|--------------|
| Conversations, memory, embeddings | Local only — `~/.blade/` |
| Screenshots (Total Recall) | Local only — `~/.blade/screenshots/` |
| API keys | OS keychain or local config |
| Your messages | Sent to **your configured provider** with **your API key** |
| Analytics / telemetry | None — BLADE has no servers |

Create `~/.blade/BLADE.md` to give BLADE workspace-level instructions (restrict access, require confirmation, set tone, etc.)

## Roadmap

- [ ] "Hey BLADE" wake word (local Whisper + Vosk) — always-on voice
- [ ] SOUL.md diff — weekly transparency report on what BLADE has learned about you
- [ ] God Mode privacy controls — per-app allowlist, blur sensitive areas
- [ ] OpenHands integration as 6th background agent target
- [ ] MCP marketplace — community tool discovery without config files
- [ ] Offline TTS — Piper / Coqui for 100% local voice
